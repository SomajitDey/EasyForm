# EasyForm

EasyForm gives you a free and easy self-hosted solution for adding (contact) forms to your static website(s). You don't, however, need
to configure any server or install anything. Your browser becomes your server!

Your smartphone or PC is perhaps always connected to the internet, even on the move. So, if you keep your browser open there, and a very 
light-weight JavaScript server runs in it, you are essentially "self-hosting" for free. EasyForm capitalizes on this.
